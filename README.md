3. Convert a number to positive if it's negative in the list. Only pass those that are converted from negative to positive to the new list. 

Note: map() function is inside filter() function. 

lst1=[-1000, 500, -600, 700, 5000, -90000, -17500] 

4. Take the first two values, run the function on them. Then take the result and the next value and have a multiplication between them. etc. When no more values are left, return the last result. 

Note: use reduce function for this 

5. Using zip and dict functions create a dictionary which has its key-value pairs coming from lst1 and lst2. 

lst1=["Netflix", "Hulu", "Sling", "Hbo"] 

lst2=[198, 166, 237, 125]
